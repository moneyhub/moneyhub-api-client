# Research Findings: Monzo Pots and providerParentAccountId

## Summary
L&G requested adding `providerParentAccountId` to the Account type in moneyhub-api-client to support Monzo pots functionality. This request has been **approved and implemented**.

## Background

### What are Monzo Pots?
Monzo pots are savings containers that allow users to separate money from their main spending account. According to the Monzo API documentation:
- Pots are linked to a main Monzo account
- Each pot has its own ID and balance
- Users can deposit/withdraw money between pots and their main account

### The Integration Challenge
When Moneyhub aggregates Monzo accounts through Open Banking:
- The main Monzo account becomes an `Account` object
- Each Monzo pot also becomes a separate `Account` object
- There was no way to establish the relationship between pots and their parent account

## Solution Implemented

### Changes Made
Added `providerParentAccountId?: string` to the `Account` interface in `src/schema/account.ts`

**Location**: Line ~77 in the Account interface, positioned with other provider-related fields

### Implementation Details
- **Type**: `string` (matches other provider ID fields)
- **Optional**: `?` marker since not all accounts have parent accounts
- **Purpose**: References the ID of the parent account for child accounts like Monzo pots

### Usage Example
```typescript
// Main Monzo account
{
  id: "acc_main_monzo_123",
  accountName: "Current Account",
  providerName: "Monzo",
  providerId: "fa37a6ecc38eea38bdf3dd0fdcb68fab",
  // ... other fields
}

// Monzo pot (child account)
{
  id: "acc_pot_savings_456", 
  accountName: "Holiday Savings Pot",
  providerName: "Monzo",
  providerId: "fa37a6ecc38eea38bdf3dd0fdcb68fab",
  providerParentAccountId: "acc_main_monzo_123",  // üëà NEW FIELD
  // ... other fields
}
```

## Testing Considerations
- Verify the property is properly serialized/deserialized
- Test with existing Monzo integrations to ensure no breaking changes
- Validate that pot-to-parent relationships are correctly established

## Impact Assessment
- **Breaking Change**: No - the field is optional
- **Backwards Compatible**: Yes - existing code will continue to work
- **Dependencies**: None - no other schema changes required

## Next Steps
1. ‚úÖ Property added to Account interface
2. üîÑ L&G team can now use `providerParentAccountId` in their Monzo pots implementation
3. üìù Consider updating API documentation to include this field
4. üß™ Integration testing with Monzo pot scenarios
